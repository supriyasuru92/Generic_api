instructions to install on sql

1) Connect MySQL Server
2) Update the settings.py >> 
DATABASES = {  
    'default': {  
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',  
        'NAME': 'my_database',  
        'USER': 'root',  
        'PASSWORD': 'your_password',  
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',  
        'PORT': '3306',  
        'OPTIONS': {  
            'init_command': "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'"  
        }  
    }  
}  

replace the 'django.db.backends.sqlite3' to 'django.db.backends.mysql'.
NAME indicates the name of the database we want to use.
USER is the MYSQL username that has access to the Database and acts as a database administrator.
PASSWORD is the password of the database. It will be created at the time of MySQL installation.
'HOST' is '127.0.0.1' and 'PORT' '3306' points out that the MySQL databaseis hosted with the hostname '0.0.1' and listens to the specific port number is 3306.
In the last line we use SET sql_mode = 'STATIC_TRANS_TABLES' which is used to handle the invalid or missing values from being stored in the database by INSERT and UPDATE statements.


3)  Install mysqlclient package
The mysqlclient is the Python interface to MySQL that allows Python project to connect to the MySQL server.

So it is necessary to install mysqlclient package to establish the connection between the MySQL and Django. To install, 
use the following command in the working directory. >> pip install mysqlclient  

4) Run the migrate command >> python manage.py migrate  
After running this command Django will automatically create the necessary tables such as auth_group, auth_user, auth_permission, etc. 
It will also create the tables which are defined in the models.py file.
